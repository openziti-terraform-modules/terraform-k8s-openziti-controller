# Terraform Module for Managing and OpenZiti Controller in Kubernetes

This module uses the Kubernetes Community implementation of Ingress for Nginx, `ingress-nginx`.

## Planned Enhancements

1. Support for other Kubernetes Ingress implementations, e.g. `traefik`
1. Support for a few implementations of Gateway API, e.g. Nginx Gateway

Please feel free to raise an issue if you have a request.
